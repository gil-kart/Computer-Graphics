# Computer-Graphics

This is a project I created while taking Computer Graphics course at the university. 

In this project, we covered all kinds of different and interesting subjects such as wire-frame viewing, lighting, shading, openGL and more.

I will present some of the work I did, explain what is being showen in the pictures that describes the project and how I implemented it.

Hope you enjoy!
